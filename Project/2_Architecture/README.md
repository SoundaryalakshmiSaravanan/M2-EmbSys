## 3.3 COMPONENTS REQUIRED
**1)** ATmega328P

**2)** HRSC04 Ultrasonic sensor

**3)**  LCD 16 X 2


**1. ATmega328-PU**

The ATmega328 is a single-chip microcontroller created by Atmel in the megaAVR family It has a modified Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC processor core.

**2.HRSC04 Ultrasonic sensor**

HRSC04 Ultrasonic sensor is used as a proximity sensor to detect a    person or object arrived at door
Ultrasonic ranging module HC - SR04 provides 2cm-400cm non-contact measurement function, the ranging accuracy can reach to 3mm. The modules include ultrasonic transmitters, receiver and control circuit.

**3.DC Motor**

The DC motor is the actuator used to open the door when the movement of people is detected.

Here DC motor of specification 

Load current: 70mA (250mA MAX) (3V pm)
          
Operating voltage: 3V ~ 12V DCTorque: 1.9 Kgf.cm
          
Speed without load: 170 RMP (3V) is  used.


**4. LCD DISPLAY**
         
  LCD display is the Human Interface of this system. Here a 16 x 2 LCD display is used. Liquid crystal display is used for displaying the messages. 

**5. Piezo Buzzer**

 Piezo buzzer is a type of electronic device that's used to produce a tone, alarm or sound.
Here piezo buzzer is a **human interface** used to alert  the user.

### 3.4 APPLICATIONS

**1)** Immense helpful for disabled people

**2)** Can be implemented in hospitals to reduce the contamination since people do not need to 
handle doors manually.

**3)** Can be implemented in warehouse to make people easier for people to go around.

### 3.5 FUTURESCOPE
 **1)** Upgrading the system using higher-bi microprocessor for speed operation

**2)** Face-detection through cameras can be implemented for automatic attendance systems.
