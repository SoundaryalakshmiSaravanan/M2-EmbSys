LCD 16 X 2
Piezo Buzzer
Power Supply
1. ATmega328-PU
The ATmega328 is a single-chip microcontroller created by Atmel in the megaAVR family It has a modified Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC processor core.
2.HRSC04 Ultrasonic sensor
 HRSC04 Ultrasonic sensor is used as a proximity sensor to detect a    person or object arrived at door
Ultrasonic ranging module HC - SR04 provides 2cm-400cm non-contact measurement function, the ranging accuracy can reach to 3mm. The modules include ultrasonic transmitters, receiver and control circuit.
3.DC Motor
The DC motor is the actuator used to open the door when the movement of people is detected.
Here DC motor of specification 
          Load current: 70mA (250mA MAX) (3V pm)
          Operating voltage: 3V ~ 12V DCTorque: 1.9 Kgf.cm
           Speed without load: 170 RMP (3V) is  used.


4. LCD DISPLAY
         
  LCD display is the Human Interface of this system. Here a 16 x 2 LCD display is used. Liquid crystal display is used for displaying the messages. 

5. Piezo Buzzer
 Piezo buzzer is a type of electronic device that's used to produce a tone, alarm or sound.
Here piezo buzzer is a human interface used to alert  the user.
### 3.4 APPLICATIONS
Immense helpful for disabled people

Can be implemented in hospitals to reduce the contamination since people do not need to 
handle doors manually.

Can be implemented in warehouse to make people easier for people to go around.
### 3.5 FUTURESCOPE
Upgrading the system using higher-bi microprocessor for speed operation
Face-detection through cameras can be implemented for automatic attendance systems.
