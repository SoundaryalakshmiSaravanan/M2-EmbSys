# AUTOMATIC DOOR OPENING SYSTEM


## 1. INTRODUCTION

 ### 1.1  ABSTRACT

The project concerns an automatic door opening and closing system. An automatic door control system includes a sensor for sensing a person or object approaching the door. Systems and methods are very common in the art for opening and closing doors to enter and exit buildings, facilities etc. Automatic doors are commonly found in retail stores, supermarkets, and the like.
 
### 1.2  PRINCIPLE OF THE SYSTEM
The project generally relates to an automatic opening and closing of doors which will sense a person or object approaching the door and open automatically. This system is controlled by an Arduino microcontroller. The system includes DC motor which makes door to slides during opening or closing by rack and pinion gearing, a LCD to display information state of door, an audio buzzer to make sound through the duration of opened door and a controller for controlling the opening and closing of the door as a person or object detected by sensor.
 ### 1.3   FEATURES OF THE SYSTEM
 1.Automatic opening of the door . 
 
2.Ability to detect the movement of people.

3.Can be accessed everywhere.
### 1.4 ADVANTAGES OF THE SYSTEM
1.Helpful for people in wheelchairs and disabled.

2.Contactless operation of the door which prevents the spread of germs.

3.Reduces manual power.
 
### 1.5  SWOT ANALYSIS
